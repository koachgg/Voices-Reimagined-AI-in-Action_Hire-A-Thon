# Problem Statement - 
REAL TIME SPEECH-TO-SPEECH SOLUTION WITH LLM SPEAKER DIARIZATION AND EMOTION DETECTION

With the rapid advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, there is an increasing need for technologies that enhance human communication through real-time speech processing. 
Our challenge was to develop an open-source speech-to-speech solution that seamlessly integrates key components: accurate real-time speech recognition supporting multiple languages and dialects, speaker diarization to distinguish and tag different speakers, emotion detection to analyze and display speakers’ emotional states based on tone and pitch, and conversation summarization to condense dialogues into essential points. By addressing these areas, we aim to create a comprehensive tool that improves real-time communication, making interactions more meaningful and efficient.

# Deliverables - 
(1) Speech Recognition : Develop an accurate speech recognition module that can convert spoken language into text in real-time. 

(2) Speaker Diarization : Implement a system that can identify and differentiate between multiple speakers in a conversation. This feature should tag who is speaking at any given time and maintain an accurate record of dialogue flow.

(3) Emotion Detection : Integrate an emotion detection algorithm that analyzes the tone and pitch of speakers’ voices to determine their emotional state (e.g., happiness, anger, sadness). This data should be presented alongside the transcribed text.

(4) Conversation Summarisation : Develop a summarization feature that condenses the dialogue into key points, allowing users to quickly grasp the essence of the conversation without needing to read or listen to the entire exchange.

(5) Text-to-Speech Conversion : Convert the text obtained from summarization into speech.

# Key Concepts Utilized
